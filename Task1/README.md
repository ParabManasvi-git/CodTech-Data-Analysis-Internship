##  Task Description (Task–1):

This repository contains the work completed for **Task–1** of the CodTech Data Analysis Internship. The objective of this task was to perform analysis on a **large dataset** using **big data processing tools** such as **PySpark**, thereby demonstrating scalability and efficient data handling.

##  Dataset Used:
The **Online Retail Dataset** was used for this task. 

The dataset is large enough to demonstrate big data processing and real-world scalability challenges.

##  Tools and Technologies Used:

- **Python** – Programming language  
- **PySpark** – Big data processing framework  
- **Google Colab** – Cloud-based development environment  
- **GitHub** – Version control and project hosting  

## Methodology:

1. The dataset was uploaded to Google Colab.
2. PySpark was initialized using SparkSession.
3. The CSV file was loaded as a Spark DataFrame.
4. Data cleaning was performed by removing null values.
5. Data analysis was conducted using PySpark operations such as:
   - groupBy  
   - aggregation functions (sum)  
   - sorting and filtering  
6. Insights were derived from the processed data.

## Analysis and Insights:

The analysis focused on identifying:
- Top countries based on sales quantity
- Top-selling products based on demand

Key insights obtained include:
- The United Kingdom recorded the highest number of product sales.
- Certain products showed extremely high demand.
- PySpark efficiently handled the large dataset without performance issues.
