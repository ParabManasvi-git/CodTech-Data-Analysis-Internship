## Task Description (Task–2):

This repository contains the work completed for **Task–2** of the CodTech Data Analysis Internship.  
The objective of this task was to perform **predictive analysis using machine learning techniques** to analyze data and predict outcomes based on selected features.

---

## Dataset Used:
The **Student Performance Dataset** was used for this task.



This dataset was suitable for applying **classification-based machine learning models**.

---

## Tools and Technologies Used:

- **Python** – Programming language  
- **Jupyter Notebook** – Development environment  
- **Pandas** – Data manipulation and analysis  
- **NumPy** – Numerical computations  
- **Matplotlib** – Data visualization  
- **Scikit-learn** – Machine learning library  
- **GitHub** – Version control and project hosting  

---

## Methodology:

1. The dataset was loaded into Jupyter Notebook using Pandas.
2. Initial data exploration and cleaning were performed.
3. A target variable (**Pass / Fail**) was created based on student scores.
4. Feature selection was carried out using:
   - Math score  
   - Reading score  
   - Writing score  
5. The dataset was split into training and testing sets.
6. A **Logistic Regression** model was trained.
7. Model performance was evaluated using:
   - Accuracy score  
   - Confusion matrix  
   - Classification report  

---

## Analysis and Insights:

The predictive analysis focused on:
- Identifying patterns in student academic performance
- Predicting whether a student would **Pass or Fail**

Key insights obtained include:
- Academic scores strongly influence student outcomes.
- Logistic Regression performed effectively for classification.
- The model achieved good accuracy on unseen test data.
- Feature selection played an important role in improving predictions.
