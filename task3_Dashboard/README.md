## 📝 Task Description

This task focuses on developing an interactive dashboard to visualize sales data using Power BI. The goal of this task is to transform raw data into meaningful visual insights that can help decision-makers understand trends and patterns easily.

The dataset used in this task contains sales information distributed across different months. Power BI was used to create an interactive dashboard that includes a line chart, slicer, and KPI card. These visuals help users analyze monthly sales performance efficiently.

A line chart was created to visualize the relationship between months and total sales. The X-axis represents months, while the Y-axis represents sales values. This visualization helps identify sales trends, growth patterns, and fluctuations over time.

To make the dashboard interactive, a month slicer was added. This allows users to filter the data by selecting a specific month and view corresponding sales details. Additionally, a total sales card was included to display the overall sales value dynamically based on the selected filter.

The dashboard provides actionable insights by highlighting peak sales months and identifying periods with lower performance. This information can be used for planning promotions, improving inventory management, and making data-driven business decisions.

Overall, this task demonstrates the ability to create a fully functional, interactive, and visually appealing dashboard using Power BI, fulfilling the internship requirements.
